## How to document to this site?

Make a pull request! 

Fork the repo, make your changes and create a pull-request. 

Unfamiliar with pull request? We're here to learn, see ChatGPT explanation: 

### What is a Pull Request (PR)?

A **pull request (PR)** is a way to **suggest changes to a code project**.

Here’s the basic idea:

1. You **make edits** in your own copy (or *branch*) of the project.
2. You **open a pull request** to ask the main project to **pull in your changes**.
3. Others can **review, comment, and suggest improvements**.
4. If everything looks good, the changes get **merged** into the main code.

✅ Think of it like:  
**“Here’s my proposed update — can you check it and approve it before it becomes official?”**

You can do this in the browsers UI (simplest) or on your own computer, which is a bit more involed but way cooler.
